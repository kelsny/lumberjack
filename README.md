# @kelsny/synth

**⚡️ A tool for synthesizing types into runtime validators.**

Give it a schema, and it gives you a validator that you can use however you'd like.

For example, it can do all of the following quite nicely:

-   ✅ Generate type guards
-   ✅ Manipulate tree-like data
-   ✅ Handle overloading like Java and C++
-   ✅ Fluent matching of values like Rust

Like the sound of it already? Go ahead and add it now:

```sh
npm install @kelsny/synth
```

Please note that it cannot do the following (yet):

-   ❌ Make you a sandwich
-   ❌ Read you a bedtime story
-   ❌ Fix your relationships
-   ❌ Solve our global crisis
