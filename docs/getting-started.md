## Getting started with Synth

It's no use if you don't have it.
Install Synth first however you'd like, either with NPM or Yarn:

```
$ npm install @kelsny/synth
```

```
$ yarn add @kelsny/synth
```

Or if you're a gigachad you might want to clone the repository and build it locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kelsny/synth.git
$ cd synth
$ tsc
$ cd ..
```
