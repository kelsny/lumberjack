## Features

### Generate type guards

The main aspect of this project is to transform a type into a real validator at runtime.
Both precompiled and dynamically created ones work, but for the best developer experience, you should precompile all your types, as they include more specific TypeScript types.
This will give you better editor suggestions and less of a fuss working with Synth.

When generated, these validators hold a specific raw TypeScript type that you can use.
To utilize the type, you can use the function `is` provided by Synth, or the type `GetSynthesized`, also provided by Synth.

Assuming you precompiled this schema under the file name `ServerError.synth`:

```ts
{
    code: number;
    message: string;
}
```

You can then use it directly by importing it from Synth:

```ts
import { is, ServerError, GetNodeType } from "@kelsny/synth";

// Get raw type if needed
// ServerErrorType is { code: number; message: string; }
type ServerErrorType = GetNodeType<typeof ServerError>;

// Create a type guard
// isServerError is (value: unknown) => value is { code: number; message: string; };
const isServerError = is(ServerError);

// Call type guard with the value as well as the validator
if (is(ServerError, value)) {
    // value is { code: number; message: string; }
    console.log(value);
}
```

### Manipulate tree-like data

### Handle overloading like Java and C/C++

### Fluent matching of values like Rust
